My name is Brent Taylor and I am a computer programmer, game developer, educator and content creator.  Creating games has always been my passion.  In 2004, Epic Games released the, “Special Edition”, of, “Unreal Tournament 2004”, a first person shooter for the PC with a long lineage.  The, “Special Edition”, included a second DVD with hundreds of hours of video tutorials by, “3D Buzz”, a legitimate copy of Maya, the SDK for Unreal 2k4 and a copy of Visual Studio.  I’d been making small baord games for years, but nothing hit me quite the way this did.  The game changed my life forever, starting me down the path to become a digital artist, animator and eventually a computer programmer.  If anyone from Epic Games ever reads this, thank you.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
